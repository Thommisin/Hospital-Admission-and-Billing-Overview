# 🏥Hospital-Admission-and-Billing-Overview
This project provides and interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing a high-level overview of hospital operations, focusing on patient admissions, billing performance, and stay duration.
---

## 📁***Project Overview***
This dashboard helps healthcare administrators:
	•	Evaluate financial performance
	•	Monitor hospital efficiency
	•	Identify top contributors (doctors & hospitals)
	•	Understand patient demographics and needs
	•	Support data-driven decisions to improve care and revenue

## 📊***Key Metrics (Overall)***
**1**.	***Top KPIs***
	•	**Total Patients(56K)**: Shows the number of patients admitted.
	•	**Total Billing Amount ($1.42bn)**: Represents the overall revenue generated from medical services.
	•	**Total Staydays (861K)**: Measures the total number of days patients stayed, indicating hospital occupancy and workload.
	**2**.	***Performance by Contributors***
	•	**Top 5 Doctors**: Displays doctors generating the highest billing amounts.
	•	**Top 5 Hospitals**: Highlights hospitals with the highest revenue, helping identify top-performing facilities.
	**3**.	***Billing Breakdown***
	•	**By Medication**: Shows which medications contribute most to total billing, useful for cost management and inventory decisions.
	•	**By Medical Condition & Admission Type**: Compares billing across major conditions (e.g., diabetes, cancer) and admission types (elective, emergency, urgent), revealing patterns in healthcare demand and urgency levels.
	**4**.	***Patients by Blood Type***
	•	Shows patient distribution based on blood group and whether their numbers are increasing or decreasing, supporting medical planning and resource allocation.

## ***Tools Used***
1. Power BI Desktop used to:
	•	Import data
	•	Clean and transform data
	•	Create visuals (bar charts, cards, tables)
	•	Build the dashboard layout
This is where the report was designed.
 2. Power Query (inside Power BI): Used for Data cleaning
 3. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) : The formulas used to create measures for percentages and trends

## ***Data Preparation Steps***

 1.	Data Collection
Gathered raw data from sources such as Excel, SQL, or CSV files.
	2.	Data Import
Loaded the datasets into Power BI Desktop.
	3.	Data Cleaning (Power Query)
	•	Removed duplicates
	•	Standardized date, text, and number formats
	•	Renamed columns clearly
	4.	Data Transformation
	•	Merged and appended related tables
	5.	Data Modeling
	•	Built a clean data model
	•	Defined relationships (one-to-many, many-to-one)
	6.	Create Calculated Columns & Measures (DAX)
	•	Created KPIs like Total Patients, Billing Amount, Staydays
	•	Built formulas for comparisons and trends
	7.	Load Clean Data to Report View
Used the prepared dataset to create visuals and dashboard.

## ***Dashboard Insights***
1. High Patient Volume
	•	A total of 56,000 patients were admitted, indicating a busy hospital system with high service demand.

2. Strong Financial Performance
	•	The hospital generated $1.42 billion in billing revenue.
	•	This shows high utilization of medical services and strong financial output.

3. Heavy Hospital Workload
	•	861,000 total staydays suggests long patient stays or many admissions.
	•	This reflects significant pressure on bed space and hospital resources.

4. Top Doctors Drive Revenue
	•	A few doctors contribute the highest billing amounts, indicating:
	•	High patient load
	•	Possibly specialized or high-value procedures
	•	These doctors are key revenue drivers.

5. Some Hospitals Outperform Others
	•	The top 5 hospitals generate significantly more billing than the rest.
	•	This shows differences in:
	•	Patient volume
	•	Hospital capacity
	•	Case complexity
	•	Location performance

6. Medication Billing Is Not Evenly Distributed
	•	A few medications contribute the highest share of billing, suggesting:
	•	They are either high-cost treatments
	•	Or used frequently
	•	Useful for budgeting and inventory planning.

7. Medical Conditions Affect Revenue
	•	Conditions like Diabetes, Cancer, Asthma, and Fibroids have high billing totals.
	•	These may represent:
	•	Common illnesses
	•	Chronic disease burdens
	•	High-cost treatments

8. Emergency Admissions Generate High Billing
	•	Emergency cases often show higher billing amounts, which aligns with:
	•	Urgent and complex procedures
	•	Intensive care needs

9. Blood Type Trends Support Resource Planning
	•	The dashboard shows the number of patients by blood type and whether the numbers are going up or down.
	•	Useful for blood bank planning and patient management.

## ***Recommendations***
The hospital should improve capacity management to reduce long staydays, provide extra support to top-performing doctors and hospitals to sustain revenue, and optimize medication inventory by focusing on high-cost drugs. Strengthening emergency workflows and enhancing chronic disease management can also improve patient outcomes and ease system pressure. Overall, balancing patient load and improving operational efficiency will boost performance across the hospitals.
